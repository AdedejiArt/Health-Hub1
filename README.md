Health Hub is a web application that aims to solve the issues of records accessiblity and patient-hospital relations to help patients have an easier relationship and interaction with their healthcare providers. Health Hub Application helps patients upload their personal records and helps hospital staff and patients have better communication in terms of appointment booking. This will allow the staff to be able to receive emails and log the appointments without needing to call each and every client. As for the patients, they will have their documents with them at all times, so they would be easy to access.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project can be used for any type of patient, from people who go to the hospital frequently to those who don't. It is a convinient way to book appointments, as there is information on the different hospitals available, with their location and departments listed, to ensure patients are able to make an informed decision. Additionally, on the records side, we made it a form, so that each user fills it resulting in the database storing essential information that hospital's need to have when considering whether to accept or decline the appointment - like surgery history and current medication usage.
